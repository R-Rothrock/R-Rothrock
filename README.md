# Roan Rothrock
Im a self trained programmer out of middle Tennessee, interested in InfoSec.
I'm currently learning _Rust_ and preparing for the _PCAP_ cert in Python.
I prefer the Linux (Debian is best) terminal to any interface provided, and
I can program Python, C, and bash, but I don't like bash scripting any more
than I need.
