# Roan Rothrock

I program C, Assembly, and Python usually on Linux (and ususally not
cross-platform, either.) If you're curious what sorts of projects I
have on GitHub, you ought to know most of my projects are unfinished
piles of rubble. I have pinned the few that I'm proud of; feel free
to take a look! I'm willing to collaborate on anything you think I'm
capable of. Feel free to contact me anytime for whatever reason
(especially typos of any sort.)

**What I'm working on now:**

 - Nothing really.
<!--
- **[cumin](https://github.com/R-Rothrock/cumin)**: Windows shellcode that will cause chaos and destruction
- **[diatom](https://github.com/R-Rothrock/diatom)**: a framework for distributed computing on Linux
!-->
**What I'm interested in:**

- Any low level code or functionality
- Just about anything Linux

**My expertise lies in:**

- C
- Assembly
- Python (though I'm a little rusty)
- Linux
- Windows
- Playing the piano
