# Roan Rothrock

I program C, Assembly, and Python usually on Linux (and ususally not
cross-platform, either). Any projects of mine worth looking at are
pinned; feel free to take a look!

**What I'm working on now:**

- **[paprika](https://github.com/R-Rothrock/paprika)**: hide your malware in a Debian binary package
- **[diatom](https://github.com/R-Rothrock/diatom)**: run a program in an emulating of another computer's environment.

**What I'm interested in:**

- Any low level code or functionality
- Just about anything Linux

**My expertise lies in:**

- C
- Python (though I'm a little rusty)
- Linux
- Assembly
